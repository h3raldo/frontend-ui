# Frontend for IntuitiveWebSolutions

I am using [Vue-Cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) for developing the frontend in Vue. 

## How to run

Not sure if the you use Vue-Cli, but it's pretty easy to get the project up and running:

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run serve` to compile and run local server @ localhost:8080
